# Sportzen ⛓⚽️♜

## Abstract

There are many sports players and teams in India and in the world who are unrecognized or rather underrated. They work day in day out without getting much recognition.

## Idea

In order to bring in more recognition and to make such things mainstream, we are  taking some important moments from the games played by players/teams and take certain moments and make NFTs of those situations.

For example: Lets take a chess game, between 2 players, we will capture some moments and put them up for voting. The best voted ones will be put up in an auction from where users can put bids on the various available NFT's and the highest bidder will own that NFT.

We are giving a virtual preview of the NFT using Augmented Reality (similar to preview for products).

## Novelty

Augmented Reality being used to give a virtual experience of a Non-Fungible Token in our preferred surroundings. This feature is similar to preview for products in an e commerce store, but has not been tried before with blockchain.
